## a few occurances in the life of miss underhill

once saw a dragon circling a distant mountain and inquired in the local village she lived just outside of in a forrest about it. 
villagers said the dragon is terrorizing them, laying waste to their fields, destroying houses, killing lifestock and has in his horde far up in the mauntain a vast fortune
yet nobody wanted to claim it since meeting the dragon means their fate is sealed and death will soon lay his cold rotting fingers upon their souls since they commited the sin of greed.

few weeks later found in a local tavern, thats called to the fermenting barrel, a group, a ork barbarian, a rouge tiefling and a elf cleric, she joined them and went in search for the gold

after sucessfully defeating the dragon, splitting the horde amongst themselves and leaving, she fell ill wich put an end to her questing carreer.
