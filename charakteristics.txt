This character has a chipper personality, is quite charismatic and quite well liked by others, tells good jokes and so on. 
  a flaw of the character is that she does panic if even the smallest things go awry, even stumbeling over her own spells wilst casting like cloud of daggers or dissonant whispers 
wich results in her often hurting herself or others in the process.
  she is quite clumsy and often screws up the simplest of tasks, even going so far to snap strings on the violin if she tries to restring or tune it or poking her leg or finger on her 
rapier whilst trying to maintain it.
  unconditional fear of cats, chests (because of mimics) and bread
she will only eat bread if it has been toasted because it does “kill and remove the evil spirits within"
